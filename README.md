# reinforcement-pong
## *Note: This is still a work in progress and does not work*
A reinforcement learning project to train an agent to play pong like a pro B)

To run the program, you can run the C program seperately and as long as the file structure is correct, you should be able to run the pygame instance and the programs should be able to interact.

The hyperparameters are at the top of the main.c file inside the network folder so have fun messing around with those

ps. the pong game is set to headless currently so just change the viewGame variable to true if you want to see the game being played in real time (in the game.py file)
