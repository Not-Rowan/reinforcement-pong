# reinforcement-pong
A reinforcement learning project to train an agent to play pong like a pro B)

To run the program, you can run the C program seperately and as long as the file structure is correct, you should be able to run the pygame instance and the programs should be able to interact.

The hyperparameters are at the top of the main.c file inside the network folder so have fun messing around with those

## Note: This is still a work in progress!!!
