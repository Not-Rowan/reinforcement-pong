# reinforcement-pong
## This is still a work in progress but it **should** work
A reinforcement learning project to train an agent to play pong like a pro B)

The hyperparameters are at the top of the main.c file inside the network folder so have fun messing around with those if you'd like

ps. You can edit the render.txt file inside the game folder to change in and out of headless. Less graphics rendering makes the training faster btw
